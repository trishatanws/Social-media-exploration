# Social-media-exploration

This project focuses on data wrangling and data preperation, before using pandas to complete the following user stories:

User Stories: 

#1: When I choose a social media network, I am able to view the number of users in each country.

#2: When I choose a country, I am able to see all the relevant social networks its people use ranked in descending order. 

#3: I can view a comparison of the percentage of users based on the population for each social media network by the population of the country.
